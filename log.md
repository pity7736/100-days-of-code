### Day 0: January 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started a small lib for holidays and working days calculations.

**Thoughts:** I learned about [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and I started to applying it in this project.

**Link to work:** [workingless project](https://github.com/pity7736/workingless)
